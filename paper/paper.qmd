  ## Background

  Zstandard (Zstd) represents a lossless data compression mechanism that is highly configurable and is aimed at coupling high compression ratios with fast compression/decompression performance. Previous studies have paired specific Zstd configurations with various file formats in bioinformatics to reduce total data volume. This paper presents a "training mode" pipeline, written in the Julia programming language, wherein a custom compression dictionary is generated from a sample FASTA set in order to explore further compression improvements and compare them to the compression performance of Xz, Zlib, Bzip2, and Lz4 compressors.
